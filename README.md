**Teaching philosophy:** Computer science and technology is mostly a practical discipline. To learn the fundamentals, an effective strategy is to follow an iterative process of `reading, analyzing, and coding`. However, many students either like to `analyze` or `code` but not both. While some of us enjoy developing the skills for critically assessing the concepts and algorithms, many others enjoy programming and love building things. I think that an effective computer science course should be a balance of (a) theoretical knowledge to understand how computer technology works, and (b) implementation skills to test and execute the theories and algorithms. I design course contents and assignments so that students have an opportunity to improve both: analytical and programming skills. Students with a rich programming experience may find this balance slightly easier but will have a platform to explore further. For many others who do not consider themselves expert programmers, taking such a course will be a rewarding experience.

## 2. Course description

Deep learning is popular because of its high applicability and superior performance in domains where we use machine learning. Deep learning based applications have reached or surpassed human performance not only for industrial problems like object classification, speech recognition, and stock market prediction but also for many problems in the field of biology and medicine. Recently, deep learning is demonstrated to outperform human radiologists in detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays. It is also reliably used in iPhone-X for unlocking the phone through accurate face detection. Self-driving cars drive using the deep learning algorithms. Deep learning will soon replace humans in most domains of human mental labor. This course reviews a typical machine learning recipe, computational foundations for deep learning, and provides an introduction to deep learning of dense neural networks. The course will focus on building, training, and evaluating deep convolutional neural networks for solving various machine learning problems, particularly the ones relating to image data. At the end of the course you will also be able to differentiate what kinds of problems are best solved by deep learning algorithms and what are not, and develop your own deep learning applications. You will also learn major technology trends in deep learning and understand what makes it different from traditional machine learning.

## 9. Academic dishonesty
Any form of academic dishonesty in this class will result in an F for the semester and the case will be referred to the provost's office for possible further disciplinary action, regardless of how trivial it is. Please don't use another student's assignment (or a solution in the internet) to complete your own assignment. Discussing the material is 'OK', but please do your work on your own. You should complete the homework alone, not together, and not in a group. If you have any questions about any of the lessons or the assignments, please contact me, and I will point you in the right direction. Please read [UMSL's policy](https://www.umsl.edu/services/academic/policy/academic-dishonesty.html) and keep yourself out of plagiarism. Also, please remember that our `turnitin` tool also automatically checks for plagiarism.

## 10. Programming language
Python3 is language for the course; you are expected to use Python3 for all of your classroom activities, homeworks, and project. You are also required to use [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or your own hosted Jupyter Notebook for running your programs.

## 11. Due dates and late policy  
* Homeworks and project phases have their respective due dates (see Schedule).
* You can request a maximum two-day extension on any homeworks or project submissions - for up to two submissions. If you email me a few hours before a deadline and I don't reply you immediately, and if you have not used your two-day extensions, you can assume that the extension is granted automatically.
* Once you use your extension days, late submissions will get no points. But, there can be exceptions.

## 12. Course project
* See [here](PROJECT.md).

## 13. Homeworks
There will be two types of homeworks: [project homeworks](./PROJECT.md), and [drawing concept maps](./CONCEPT-MAP.md) as chapter summaries. Homeworks should be submitted via Canvas. Concept maps should be submitted to the respective discussion boards so they are visible to other students in the class. You can view the concept maps uploaded by other students in the class only after you have submitted yours.

## 14. Quizes
There will be no comprehensive tests in this course. Along with concept map homeworks, after watching the module lectures, you will need to take a five minute quiz. The questions on the quiz will be be multiple-choice or true/false type. Please take this quiz right after watching the module lectures. Also, before taking the quiz, please refer to the [Proctorio instructions](https://github.com/badriadhikari/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Proctorio_instructions.md).

## 15. Grade composition  

| Submission | Total Points |
| :--- | ---: |
| Chapter concept maps | 30 |
| Chapter quizes | 30 |
| Project | 40 |

Note: One (1) bonus point will be assigned to everyone who completes the course evaluation survey. Please email me once you submit the survey.

## 16.Grading scheme  

| Points      | Grade |
| ----------- | ----- |
